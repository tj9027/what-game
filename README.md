# What-game üéÆ

What game is an API that given an id of a video of YouTube or id of a streamer from Twitch.tv can give back details about the YouTube video or the streamer online status.
It also gives the details about the game if gaming-related.

## How it works :eyeglasses:

What-game has two endpoints

```
/youtube
/twitch
```

feeding json as the body for the request to one endpoint with a
`key` of id

and as

`value` the id of a youtube video or twitch streamer id,

```
{
  "id":"{id of choice}"
}
```

What-game will search youtube or twitch API for some details needed and then scrape the webpage related to the `id` provided.

the output will look like these examples;

###### given

```
{
"id": "110690086"
}
```

###### twitch API

```
{
  "details": {
      "status": "online",
      "game": "VALORANT"
  },
  "name": "Myth"
}
```

###### given

```
{
"id":"guST_zQarU8"
}
```

###### youtube API

## How to run üèá

to run the application on your machine you need:

1- Node js version 13.x or less `node js v 14.x is not yet supported`

2- YouTube API key. To get this, follow these instructions
https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started

3- Twitch Client-ID. To get this, follow these instructions
https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5

once you have all the necessary, you can download or clone this repository to your machine and continue.

4- Inside your project folder, create a file called `.env` and copy the following lines.

```
PORT = {your port of choice the default is 3000}
API_KEY= {your youtube api key}
CLIENT_ID = {your twitch client id}
```

5- From your terminal, make sure to be located inside the project folder, run this command:

`npm i`

npm is prefered due to some issues with `yarn`.

6- Once the command finished its' execution, copy and run the following:

`node index`

7- done.

8- If you get some errors, don't hesitate to leave me a message and will help you out.

## What I learned üí°

During this project, I learned:

- YouTube and Twitch APIs and how they built their websites.
- Multiple ways to do http requests from Node js.
- Handle multiple asychronous functions

## What to improve üìñ

- Create a UI for an easier way to visualize data.
- Find alternative to my solution due to the long response delay.
- Refactor the code.
- Write tests
- Normalize the response data in a better way.
- Modify the functions so that it can accept an array of IDs and output an array of objects for each ID.
- Better selectors for the scraper function
- Merge the 2 endpoints and manage the id type internally
- Create cli-tool
- When querying for twitch, puppeteer can be avoided
